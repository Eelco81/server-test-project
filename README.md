# server-test-project

This project is my test bin for trying out some new things.

Current stack:
- C++11/14/17 for server (Linux/Windows).
- GoogleMock / GoogleTest for unit tests.
- python / behave for integration tests.
- VueJS for client side javascript (with JQuery, GoogleCharts and Bootstrap).

See the root makefile for build instructions.
