# server-test-project

This project is my test bin for trying out some new things.

Current stack:
- C++11/14/17 for server and client (Linux/Windows).
- GoogleMock / GoogleTest for unit tests.
- Python / Behave for integration tests (using websocket-client, requests and assertpy).
- VueJS for client side javascript (with JQuery, plotly.js, Bootstrap and FontAwesome).
- NodeJS, Karma, Mocha, WebPack for client code testing and packaging.

See the root makefile for build instructions.
